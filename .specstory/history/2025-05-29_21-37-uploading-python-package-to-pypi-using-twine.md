# Uploading Python package to PyPI using Twine (2025-05-30 00:37:56)

how to upload build from dist into pip?

python -m ... waht next?

---

_**Assistant**_

To upload your build from the `` folder to [PyPI](https://pypi.org/), follow these steps:

1. **Build your package** (if you haven't already):

```powershell
python -m build
```

2. **Upload to PyPI** using [twine](https://twine.readthedocs.io/):

```powershell
python -m twine upload dist/*
```

**Notes:**
- You may need to install `build` and `twine` first:
    ```powershell
    pip install build twine
    ```
- You will be prompted for your PyPI username and password.

**Summary:**  
`python -m build`  
`python -m twine upload dist/*`

The error occurs because in your `TypeScriptTypeWithDependencies` class, the `type` field is required but not given a default value, and you have a typo in the field name `dependenices` (should be `dependencies`). Also, the forward reference in the type hint for `dependencies` should be handled with quotes or by updating `__annotations__` after the class definition.

Here's how you can fix these issues:

1. **Fix the typo**: Change `dependenices` to `dependencies`.
2. **Set a default for `type`** or ensure it's always provided.
3. **Handle forward references**: Use `from __future__ import annotations` (Python 3.7+) or update `__annotations__` after the class.

Here's a corrected version:

````python
from __future__ import annotations
from typing import TYPE_CHECKING

class TypeScriptTypeWithDependencies(BaseModel):
    name: str | None = None
    dependencies: dict[str, TypeScriptTypeWithDependencies] = {}
    type: str  # This is required, so always provide it when instantiating

# ...existing code...
````

**Key points:**
- Always provide the `type` argument when creating `TypeScriptTypeWithDependencies`.
- Fix the typo in the field name.
- Use `from __future__ import annotations` to handle forward references cleanly.

Let me know if you need more help with the `_schema_to_ts` function!

if value_type == type(None):
Explain "type" is unbound

_**Assistant**_

The error **"type is unbound"** means that the variable `type` is being used before it has been assigned a value in the current scope.

In your code:

```python
if value_type == type(None):
```

Here, `type` is **not** unbound.  
- `type` is a built-in Python function that returns the type of an object.
- `type(None)` returns the `<class 'NoneType'>` object.

So, this line is correct and checks if `value_type` is the `NoneType`.

**If you see "type is unbound" elsewhere in your code**, it likely means you have a variable named `type` that you are trying to use before assigning a value to it, or you have a typo or scoping issue.  
But in this specific line, `type` refers to the built-in and is not unbound.
